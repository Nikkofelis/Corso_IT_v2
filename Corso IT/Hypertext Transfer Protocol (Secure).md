When a client, typically a web browser, sends a request to a web server, HTTP specifies the message types used for that communication.

It uses [TCP](Transmission%20Control%20Protocol%20(TCP).md) to transfer data on the port 80.

The three common message types are GET, POST, and PUT:

- **GET** - This is a client request for data. A client (web browser) sends the GET message to the web server to request HTML pages.
- **POST** - This uploads data files to the web server, such as form data.
- **PUT** - This uploads resources or content to the web server, such as an image.
