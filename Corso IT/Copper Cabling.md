Data is transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses. However, the farther the signal travels, the more it deteriorates. This is referred to as signal **attenuation**.

The timing and voltage values of the electrical pulses are also susceptible to interference from two sources:

- **Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI)**: EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt the data signals being carried by copper media. Potential sources of EMI and RFI include radio waves and electromagnetic devices.
- **Crosstalk**: Disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire.
