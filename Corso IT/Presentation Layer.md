The presentation layer has three primary functions:

- **Formatting**, or presenting, data at the source device into a compatible format for receipt by the destination device (file extension).
- **Compressing** data in a way that can be decompressed by the destination device.
- **Encrypting** data for transmission and decrypting data upon receipt.
