UTP cabling is the most common networking media. UTP cabling, terminated with RJ-45 connectors.

Types: 

- **Ethernet Straight-through**: The most common type of networking cable. It is used to interconnect two devices of different families (MDI and MDIx). It has the same standard in both ends (both T568A or T568B).
- **Ethernet Crossover**: A cable used to interconnect devices of the same family. However, crossover cables are now considered legacy as NICs use medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) to automatically detect the cable type and make the internal connection. It has a different standard on each end (T568A on one end and T568B on the other).

# Properties

UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI. To reduce crosstalk they use:

- **Cancellation** - ==Pairing wires in a circuit==. When two wires in an electrical circuit are placed close together, their magnetic fields are the exact opposite of each other.
- **Varying the number of twists per wire pair** - Use to further enhance the cancellation effect of paired circuit wires. UTP cable must follow precise specifications governing ==how many twists or braids are permitted per meter of cable==.
