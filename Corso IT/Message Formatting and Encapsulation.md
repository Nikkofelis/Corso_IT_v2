When a message is sent from source to destination, it must use a specific format or structure. Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.
```

- **Formatting**: Identifies the addresses of sender and receiver
- **Encapsulation**: The act of layering the message format inside another one. Transform the message from data to binary format.
- **Decapsulation**: The opposite process of **Encapsulation**.

Similar to sending a letter, a message that is sent over a computer network follows specific format rules for it to be delivered and processed.

The IPv6 is like the envelope of a letter: containing both source and destination address.
