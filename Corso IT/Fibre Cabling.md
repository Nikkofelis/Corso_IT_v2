Fiber-optic cables are broadly classified into two types:

- **Single-mode fibre (SMF)**: ==laser emitter==, useful for long distance
- **Multimode fibre (MMF)**: ==led emitter==, cheaper but not suitable for long distance

- VDSL (mixed fibre-copper)
- FTTH
	- ILC: owned cable
	- GPON: shared cable
