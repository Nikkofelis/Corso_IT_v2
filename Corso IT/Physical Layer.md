```ad-abstract
The OSI physical layer provides the means to transport the bits that make up a data link layer frame across the network media.

## Bandwidth

```ad-abstract
title: Bandwidth

The capacity at which a medium can carry data. Typically measured in kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).
```

#### Terminology

```ad-abstract
title: Latency

The amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
```

```ad-abstract
title: Throughput

The measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time across a media. Usually lower than bandwidth.
```

```ad-abstract
title: Goodput

The measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time. It's like the throughput without the overhead. Usually lower than throughput.
```
