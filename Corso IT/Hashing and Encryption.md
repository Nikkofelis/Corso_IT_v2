Mathematical irreversible function of substitute an input in an output.

# Encryption

- **Symmetric**: requires a decryption key for each session
- **Asymmetric**: requires 2 keys for each user (a public one and a private one). The public one (receiver) is used to encrypt data sent to the receiver, the receiver then uses the private one (receiver) to de-encrypt the data.
